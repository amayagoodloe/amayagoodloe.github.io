I am a marketing major at Maryville College, a small liberal arts college located in Maryville TN. I will be graduating in May of 2022. I am reaching out to you today seeking to gain relevant experience, advice, mentorship and exposure to a larger network of individuals who are where I want to be. This would optimally lead to an internship or potential employment. By starting this process now, I believe that I will be positioned to provide instant value to an organization upon graduation.

I am a marketing major minoring in psychology at Maryville College, a small liberal arts college located in Maryville TN. I will be graduating in May of 2022. I plan to pursue a career as a market research analyst ultimately leading to a position as a Chief Marketing Officer. I hope to use my psychology minor to better understand the customer and apply that knowledge in a corporate setting. My passion is in the creative process and I enjoy expressing myself as well as helping others express their own unique ideas through design. 

Currently, I am interning with a startup tech company CCNOAI. With CCNOAI, I have been assigned the lead for the company's marketing endeavours. My ultimate responsibility is to create, communicate and deliver offerings which have value for our clients. I have become truly intrigued by the challenges tech companies face to express the value of their products and marketing strategy. I have been able to design several marketing and explainer videos to convey these values. It is a challenge yet, a great opportunity to translate less understood technology and processes to our customers in an effective manner. I am also creating marketing strategies to obtain funding through grants and proposals. This work has fueled my desire to explore and expand my knowledge, seek new opportunities and discover more about my passions within a company such as yours.

I’d like to briefly summarize my background and explain why I would be an asset to your company. I was born and raised in Knoxville Tennessee by my mother. My whole life I have been a student athlete striving to balance and excel at both. I have developed skills such as communication, time management, teamwork, problem solving and leadership. The academic and athletic (softball) opportunities offered at Maryville College made the school a good fit for me. 

Growing up in Knoxville, I was part of the ethnic minority as there is little diversity in the community. This translated to the softball field where I realized that, just like the classroom, I would have to work hard to be seen no matter what abilities I have. My teammates don’t look like me (less than 6% of collegiate softball players are black), neither do my classmates. I’ve had to overcome the challenges and oftentimes discomfort of being the only African-American woman in the majority of the environments I have been exposed to. In Silicon Valley, When it comes to tech leadership positions, black women in particular make up less than 0.5% of the workforce.

However, I am filled with optimism and I realize that the challenges I have faced have shaped me towards realizing my potential as a student, athlete and future professional. Through the pandemic, I have made it a goal to seek out and speak to professional women to hear their experiences and find ways to keep improving myself. These are my role models and I want to carry the torch of being an advocate for women and girls in the U.S. and around the world.

Thank for your time and consideration,

Amaya Goodloe
